### Component Architecture Principles
1. **Atomic Design**: Atoms → Molecules → Organisms → Templates → Pages
2. **Feature-based Organization**: Group related components together
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Logic, presentation, and styling separated
4. **Composition over Inheritance**: Use hooks and composition patterns

### State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Store Structure
{
  auth: {
    user: User | null,
    isAuthenticated: boolean,
    loading: boolean
  },
  dashboard: {
    kpis: DashboardKPIs,
