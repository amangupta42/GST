# GST Compliance Dashboard: Complete Development Blueprint

## Executive Summary

The GST Compliance Dashboard addresses a massive pain point for 70% of Indian SMEs struggling with GST compliance. With new 2025 reforms introducing e-invoicing requirements for businesses with ₹10 crore+ turnover, 30-day filing deadlines, and rate simplification to 5%/18%/40% slabs, the need for simple, affordable GST tools has never been more critical. This product targets the underserved segment of small manufacturers, traders, and service providers (₹5-50 crore turnover) who find existing solutions like TallyPrime (₹22,500-67,500) and ClearTax (₹10,000+/year) too expensive and complex.

## Market Opportunity & Problem Analysis

### Critical Pain Points
1. **Compliance Complexity**: SMEs must file 37 returns annually (GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, GSTR-9, etc.), with new 30-day e-invoicing deadlines

3. **Rate Classification Confusion**: With GST 2.0's new structure, businesses struggle with correct HSN classification
4. **Working Capital Blockage**: 40% of SMEs face cash flow issues due to delayed GST refunds
5. **Language Barriers**: 488 million rural users lack tools in regional languages
6. **Inverted Duty Structure**: Manufacturers paying 18% on inputs but charging 12% on outputs face working capital issues

### Market Size
