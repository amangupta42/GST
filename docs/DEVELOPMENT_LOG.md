## Scrapped Ideas & Decisions

### Rejected Approaches
**❌ Fixed Sidebar Positioning**
- **Tried**: CSS fixed positioning for sidebar
- **Problem**: Conflicted with MUI drawer system and responsive behavior
- **Solution**: Used standard MUI permanent/temporary drawer pattern

**❌ Tailwind-Only Styling**
- **Tried**: Pure Tailwind CSS for all components
- **Problem**: Complex to maintain consistency, harder theming
- **Solution**: Material-UI as primary with Tailwind as utility layer

**❌ Single File Layout**
- **Tried**: All layout logic in one component
- **Problem**: Too complex, harder to maintain
- **Solution**: Split into Sidebar, TopNavigation, and DashboardLayout

### Design Decisions
**✅ 280px Sidebar Width**: Provides good balance of navigation space and content area  
**✅ Blue/Green Color Scheme**: Professional, trustworthy colors for financial application  
**✅ Mobile-First Responsive**: Ensures good mobile experience for on-the-go GST compliance  
**✅ Material-UI Component Library**: Provides consistency and accessibility out of the box  

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Styling**: MUI sx prop for component styling, Tailwind for utilities
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Import Order**: React, MUI, internal components, utilities, types

### Commit Strategy
- **Feature commits**: Each major feature as separate commit
- **Fix commits**: Bug fixes with clear description
- **Structure commits**: File organization and refactoring
- **Documentation commits**: Updates to documentation

### Testing Strategy (Planned)
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: MSW for API mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+ for business logic
